USP (Unique Selling Point) of this Dashboard?
While people being locked down due to COVID-19 pandemic, the true spirit of working together is lost. Due to that some sectors have lost their core purpose. This has impact on businesses and employment. So, we are doing this presentation to show how employment has been affected with the current situation state wise pandemic situation in USA.
Insights we want to bring is which state has been most affected and which sector has been most effected during the last 3 months. 

Nice to know about the dashboard:
Dashboard is interactive to show the unemployment rate based on the user selection of the state.
Dashboard is interactive to show the currently employed based on the sector as well as state selection
One can draw conclusions based on seasonal comparison of employment rate in each state.
